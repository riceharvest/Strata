"""Finding the engine package for this machine in a local component folder. There is no download path.

The engine (the C++ `strata` binary and its GPU runtime libraries) is a separate, independently versioned
component. The desktop app and the terminal start whatever is installed in the component folder; nothing here, and
nothing on the start path, fetches an engine. A missing or unusable engine is a typed error that says what to do
(`EngineMissing`, exit code 5, the same family as `acquisition.AcquisitionRefused`) and never an attempt to get one.

Layout (``components_dir()``)::

    <components>/engine/<version>-<platform>-<backend>/
        engine-component.json        the manifest (below)
        strata.exe | strata          the entrypoint (path from the manifest)
        *.dll | *.so                 the GPU runtime libraries, hashed in the manifest too
        BUILD.json                   optional, the engine's own build record

Manifest (``engine-component.json``, schema 2; schema 1 packages still load). packaging/README.md has the full table::

    {"schema_version": 2, "id": "strata-engine", "name": "strata-engine", "version": "0.1.45",
     "platform": "linux-x86_64", "backend": "sycl", "archs": ["intel-arc"],
     "min_driver": {}, "build_id": "be885026f9-sycl", "min_runtime": "0.1.45",
     "entrypoint": "strata", "files": [{"path": "strata", "sha256": "...", "bytes": 1}, ...],
     "signature": null}                      # S6 fills it; verify_signature() is the hook

Checks, in order, and each one names what failed:

* the manifest parses strictly; file paths are relative, plain, and stay inside the component folder;
* the platform and backend are combinations the project commits to (`components.BACKEND_MATRIX`);
* the backend is the one this machine's GPU needs (detected, or asked for);
* the signature (none yet; a verifier registered by S6 is called, and `STRATA_REQUIRE_SIGNED_COMPONENTS=1` refuses
  an unsigned or unverifiable package);
* every listed file exists with the listed size, and every file's SHA-256 matches (`verify(full=True)`, which is what
  a start does; the quick listing/status path hashes only the entrypoint);
* the runtime that is asking is new enough for `min_runtime`. A package that fails an integrity check is
  `EngineIntegrityError`: nothing is started.

Nothing here imports anything outside the standard library and `strata_control`.
