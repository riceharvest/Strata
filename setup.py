"""Strata one-click setup and start for the Intel Arc Pro B70 (Linux, the SYCL engine built from sycl/, docs/B70.md).

    ./setup.sh [--backend sycl] [options]      - installs Python if needed and runs this file

This setup has one engine: the SYCL build.  Every run goes through sycl/setup_intel.py (sycl_setup below), which finds
the Intel Arc card in sysfs, puts it into this file's card path (the steps named "AMD"/"hip" here, kept as the hooks
setup_intel.py replaces) and runs main() again with --backend hip.  The SYCL engine is built outside setup
(sycl/tools/build.sh in the strata-sycl-dev image); setup builds only the picture readers.

The first time it asks which model, which size, how much context and whether the model should also read pictures, then
installs everything and writes run-<model>.sh, which starts sycl/serve/server_intel.py on http://127.0.0.1:8080
(OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible API).  Every later start skips straight to running the model: nothing that is already
downloaded, installed or prepared is done again.

What the first run does (each step is skipped when it is already done):

  1. checks your PC: the Intel Arc card, RAM, CPU, free disk space
  2. asks the questions
  3. installs the Python packages it needs into .venv (numpy, jinja2, ...)
  4. the engine folder: the picture readers (CPU, and with --vision gpu the SYCL one) beside the SYCL engine
  5. downloads the model from Hugging Face (resumable), and the vision encoder if you want images
  6. prepares the model for Strata and fetches the MTP draft layer (~5 GB, from the original Qwen checkpoint)
  7. writes the run config (strata-<model>.json) and run-<model>.sh and starts the model

Options: --family qwen|swift|coder|unsloth|gyro|deepseek41, --model Q2_0|IQ2_XS|IQ3_XXS|IQ3_S|..., --context 32768,
--rope-scaling none|linear|yarn (--rope-scale F; past the trained 262144 the setup adds yarn and the factor is the
final context over 262144, at least 1 - an explicit --rope-scaling none is refused for such a context), --vision
yes|no|gpu|cpu, --port 8080, --yes (recommended answers, no questions), --setup (install another model / change
settings instead of starting), --no-start, --host 0.0.0.0 --api-key KEY (reach it from other devices on your network),
--experimental-speed-projection on|off (EXPERIMENTAL, off by default), --models-dir DIR, --gguf-dir DIR (use GGUF files
you already have), --check (only check this PC), --resident-budget-gib N (UD-Q4_K_XL's or UD-IQ4_XS's experts in RAM),
--kv-streaming on|off|auto.

Setup recommends, it never forces: the recommended answers are the defaults (--yes, or Enter), and a bigger choice
than it recommends - a longer context, more GPUs, a bigger RAM budget, a size it thinks will not fit - is kept, with
what it risks.  With --yes, an explicit flag (--model, --gpus, ...) is the consent to a risk setup would otherwise
stop at; --yes alone is not.

# DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash (GGUF architecture deepseek41), Unsloth's UD-Q8_K_XL at the revision the port was checked against: a
# family with an engine of its own (strata-dsv41, src/dsv41, ported from Project Maya's maya-ds4, MIT) that is not a
# Flash-Next pack and not a single GGUF: nine shards (508.4 GB, the routed experts as MXFP4, the dense weights in BF16, and
# in shard 8 the 202.8 GB n-gram table that stays on the SSD), the engine's pack folder (tools/dsv41/pack_gguf.py: hash
# tables, tensor map, the tokenizer and the GGUF's own chat template, a few MB) beside them.  MULTI_FILE_FAMILIES, offered
# in the same menu and installed by install_dsv41.  Where it fits: strata_control/dsv41_fit.py (real numbers).  The DSpark
# drafter (dspark-...-Q8_0.gguf, 8.0 GB) and the picture reader (mmproj-BF16.gguf, 1.0 GB) are pinned here but not fetched: the
# engine does not use them yet.
